Nmap scan report for 192.168.152.55
Host is up, received reset ttl 255 (0.0022s latency).
Scanned at 2025-05-26 09:48:33 EDT for 11s
All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.152.55 are in ignored states.
Not shown: 1000 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port
OS fingerprint not ideal because: Missing an open TCP port so results incomplete
Aggressive OS guesses: 3Com 4500G switch (92%), H3C Comware 5.20 (92%), Huawei VRP 8.100 (92%), Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP1 (92%), Oracle Virtualbox Slirp NAT bridge (92%), QEMU user mode network gateway (92%), AXIS 2100 Network Camera (92%), D-Link DP-300U, DP-G310, or Hamlet HPS01UU print server (92%), HP Tru64 UNIX 5.1A (92%), Sanyo PLC-XU88 digital video projector (92%)
